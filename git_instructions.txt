BASIC TUTORIAL FOR USING GITHUB VIA TERMINAL (MAC) or GITBASH

(1) Download (clone) the relevant repository (repo) to your computer: 
    -Navigate to desired repo on GitHub.com
    -Click the green 'clone or download button' and copy the URL
    -Open terminal
    -Navigate to where you would like to put the repo
    -Type 

        git clone "URL" (type the actual URL here)

    -Press ENTER 
    -The repo clone is now downloaded; you can edit the files as desired, but these edits will only affect the real repo if you update it properly.

(2) Update GitHub repo:
    -To add these changes to a commit (i.e., put them 'on deck' to update GitHub repo), type

        git add FILENAME (type the name of the changed file w/out quotes here)
    OR  git add . (USE THIS TO READY UP CHANGES TO MANY FILES)  

    -Then add a description of what was changed in this update by typing

        git commit -m "MESSAGE" (type your message w/ quotes here)

    -Then, to sync this commit with the GitHub repo, type

        git push

(3) To pull (i.e., add) changes from the real GitHub repository to your clone, type

        git pull

(4) At any time, you can check the status of your clone repository by typing 

        git status

    This will output the ways in which your clone differs from the real repository, along with other details.
